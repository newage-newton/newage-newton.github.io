# Thoughts



## Hyderabad - July 15, 2020

I am living alone during the pandemic. People react differently to little or no social interaction. My network of dependable friends has kept me going through the pandemic. Living alone gives me a lot of time to think. I started this page to jot down my thoughts. This text below may or may not make sense. It is as much as for me as it is for someone else. After the pandemic has passed, I can go through them to learn some lessons.

Organising my thoughts has always been peaceful. Trying to weave a coherent story with all the information I'm bombarded with everyday. Trying to fit it in my belief system. Or change my assumptions. It is a continuous process that has been going on throughout my life. Indoctrination makes the job easier. Although some kind of implicit indoctrination is unavoidable due to the gregariousness of the species, I try to expose myself to as many ideas as possible to expand my worldview and avoid subscription to a particular belief system.

Think about about this -
if you find what's written here engaging and come back again to read if I have written something new,
are you subscribing to my belief system?
```

I feel I have found the reason people get attracted to religion. The pandemic and the resulting isolation has shown me the value of community. The value of constructive dialogue. The ease of somebody else explaining me how the world works rather than me finding it out on my own. I find uncertainty painful. But uncertainty is the norm. Prior to this pandemic the sense of uncertainty was not as profound as it is now. In an age where exploration means visiting a place online and then visiting it in-person, it's difficult to wrap my head around the uncharted territory created by the pandemic.

Online games, especially role-playing games provide the required escapism in the current monotonousness of life where home and workplace have merged.
